# Todo CLI - A Simple To-Do List Manager in Rust

**Todo CLI** is a command-line application written in Rust for managing your to-do list. With this CLI, you can add, list, mark as completed, remove, export, and import tasks from your to-do list, all from the comfort of your terminal.

---

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **List tasks**: View all pending tasks.
- **Complete tasks**: Mark a task as completed.
- **Remove tasks**: Delete a task from the list.
- **Export tasks**: Export all your tasks to a JSON file.
- **Import tasks**: Import tasks from a JSON file.
- **Dry Run mode**: Allows importing tasks without making any changes to your list.

---

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.50 or higher.
- Cargo (Rust's package manager, included with Rust).

---

## Installation

To install and use the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DelgadoElias/ede-todo.git
   cd ede-todo
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Install the binary system-wide** (optional):

   ```bash
   cargo install --path .
   ```

   This will install the `ede-todo` binary globally on your system.

---

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the CLI with the following commands:

### 1. Add a Task

To add a new task to your to-do list:

```bash
ede-cli add --task "My new task"
```

### 2. List Tasks

To view all pending tasks:

```bash
ede-cli list
```

### 3. Complete a Task

To mark a task as completed (for example, task ID 1):

```bash
ede-cli complete --id 1
```

### 4. Remove a Task

To delete a task from the list (for example, task ID 1):

```bash
ede-cli remove --id 1
```

### 5. Export Tasks to a JSON File

To export all tasks to a file named `tasks.json` (you can change it passing --file arg, but for default is tasks.json):

```bash
ede-cli export --file tasks.json
```

### 6. Import Tasks from a JSON File

To import tasks from a JSON file (`tasks.json`):

```bash
ede-cli import --file tasks.json
```

#### Dry Run Mode

If you only want to see which tasks would be imported without making changes, you can use the dry run mode:

```bash
ede-cli import --file tasks.json --dry-run
```

## Example Usage

```bash
$ ede-cli add --task "Buy milk"
‚úÖ Task added: Buy milk

$ ede-cli list

I'm trying to use tarpaulin with almost 80% of code coverage but I think I'm not doing well :c
